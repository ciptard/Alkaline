<p>Individual images can be managed by choosing the <strong>Library</strong>. If you have a large library, find the image you&#8217;re seeking by performing a search.</p>

<p>To change multiple images simultaneously, choose <strong>Editor</strong>. You can select multiple images to perform an operation on using the drop-down function selector. Choose a cluster of images by selecting the first image in the cluster and then, while holding down the Shift key on your keyboard, selecting the last image in the cluster. To determine the images shown in the Editor, choose the <strong>Library</strong>, perform a search, and then choose <strong>Bulk Editor</strong>.</p>

<p>Remember, all fields are optional and can be edited later.</p>

You can also use words such as &#8220;now&#8221;, &#8220;today&#8221;, or &#8220;tomorrow&#8221; as well as relative times such as &#8220;+7 days&#8221; to publish the image in a week. This field can also be left blank and will remain unpublished until you enter a date later.</p>

<p>The privacy level only affects published images. Unpublished images can only be browsed through the administrative dashboard.</p>

<p>Deleting a image permanently removes it and all of its associated data (including comments) from Alkaline. Additionally, the physical file is erased from your <code>/images/</code> folder. This action cannot be undone.</p>
