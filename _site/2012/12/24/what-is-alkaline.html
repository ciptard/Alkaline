			<h3 id='what_is_alkaline'>What is Alkaline?</h3>

<p>Alkaline is an application to upload, organize, and showcase images on the Internet. It&#8217;s intended to be installed on your Web site&#8211;just like <a href='http://www.wordpress.org/'>WordPress</a>. Most Web hosting providers are compatible with Alkaline, and we have a <a href='/compatibility/'>compatibility suite</a> to automatically check for you. Installing and using Alkaline does not require a Ph.D in computer science; if you know some HTML and have experience transferring files via FTP, you already know everything you need to hit the ground running.</p>

<h5 id='who_uses_alkaline'>Who uses Alkaline?</h5>

<p>Alkaline is intended for any person or organization that has a large collection of images. While originally built for photographers, the application can be used by illustrators, painters, and archivists as well as most industries from realtors to universities. Web designers and developers rely on Alkaline for their clients&#8217; Web sites.</p>

<h5 id='why_choose_alkaline'>Why choose Alkaline?</h5>

<p>Unlike most content management systems, Alkaline was built for images, not text. As such, it works &#8220;out of the box&#8221; and requires no modification to efficiently handle large image collections. Developed in 2010, and still under active development today, Alkaline has a larger, more robust toolkit of features than any of its competitors. Not only is Alkaline the most powerful solution on the market, but as a commercial product, we can provide a quality of technical support that no open source project can.</p>
