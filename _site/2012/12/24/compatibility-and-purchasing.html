<p>Before you purchase an Alkaline license for your Web site, you should ensure the software is compatible with your Web hosting environment. Alkaline works in any variety of different configurations&#8211;including shared, private, and dedicated hosting&#8211;but also has strict minimum requirements to function.</p>

<h5 id='requirements'>Requirements</h5>

<p>Alkaline was designed for Linux-based operating systems (such as CentOS) running Apache 2 as well as WindowsÂ® Server 2008 running IIS 7. Alkaline should operate on most modern Web servers with little to no modification. Additionally, Alkaline requires:</p>

<ul>
<li>PHP 5.2+ with modules: GD, JSON, PDO (with appropriate database driver), SimpleXML</li>

<li>A MySQL 5.x or PostgreSQL 8.x database, or SQLite 3.x support</li>
</ul>

<p>Unsure? Let our <a href='/compatibility/'>compatibility suite</a> check your configuration automatically. The user installing Alkaline should also have rudimentary knowledge of HTML and previous experience transferring files via FTP. Also, additional RAM may need to be allocated to PHP in order for Alkaline to process very large images; your Web hosting provider should be able to do this for you.</p>

<h5 id='purchasing'>Purchasing</h5>

<p>As of August 2010, Alkaline is now open source software and <a href='https://github.com/jacobbudin/Alkaline'>available for free on GitHub</a>.</p>
<!-- Alkaline is purchased on a per-site basis. You will need one license for every Web site you wish to use the software. Running multiple installations of Alkaline with a single license--even on the same domain name--is strictly prohibited.

Edition 			|	Price
--------------------|------------------
Alkaline			|	$79 per site
Alkaline Multiuser	|	$249 per site

Alkaline licenses are perpetual. You can use the software for any length of time without paying an additional fees. Additionally, you are entitled to free in-version updates, so any "point" updates we release are made available free of charge to licensees. For example, licensees can upgrade from v1.0 to v1.1 for free, but not from v1.1 to v2.0.

Every new license is supported for 60 days from its date of purchase. You can purchase additional support from us should you need it. We support extensions developed by Alkaline Labs, as an outfits of Budin Ltd., our parent company. We do not support third-party themes, extensions, or modifications.

All prices are in U.S. dollars, and all sales are final. We do not currently offer academic or non-profit pricing.

###### Alkaline vs. Alkaline Multiuser

Alkaline and Alkaline Multiuser have the same exact functionality with one exception: number of administrative users. Alkaline is limited to one user. Alkaline Multiuser can have unlimited users. (Users have separate usernames, passwords, preferences, etc., and can access the dashboard and upload photos.)

Alkaline is intended for individuals can be used for both personal and commercial use. Alkaline Multiuser is intended for organizations and businesses and has stricter licensing requirements. Certain uses (such as developing a photo sharing site) and industries (any industry in which photography is the primary offering or on which the primary offering relies) are prohibited; these enterprises must purchase Alkaline Enterprise, a separate product with additional capabilities and enterprise-level support. For more information, please read the [Alkaline End User Licensing Agreement (EULA)](/eula/).

##### Professional Installation

When you order pro installation at checkout, an Alkaline engineer will install Alkaline on your Web site. It will be installed same or next business day (excluding holidays) once you supply us with your account log-in details (both FTP and control panel). If we are unable to install Alkaline for any reason, the cost of the this service will be refunded.

##### License Activation

After purchasing your license, you will be asked to associate your license with a specific domain name. If you decide to move your Alkaline installation, simply change the domain name associated with your license through our [user lounge](/users/). -->
