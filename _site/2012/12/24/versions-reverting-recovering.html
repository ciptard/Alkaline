<p>Alkaline includes multiple features to improve your CMS experience including versions, reverting, and recovering. Additionally, Alkaline autosaves most content, so should you accidentally click a link or close your browser Window, your work (or a very recent version of it) is saved. You&#8217;ll automatically be notified when auto-saved material is available for recovery.</p>

<h5 id='versions_and_reverting'>Versions and Reverting</h5>

<p>Alkaline automatically retains a copy of every post and page you publish when you save your changes. Version control allows you to review the changes between the current document and an older version.</p>

<p>Click &#8220;Compare to previous version&#8221; on any post or page to compare the differences. Once the differences are calculated and displayed, you can then copy and paste content you accidentally deleted back to the post or page you&#8217;re viewing.</p>

<p>You&#8217;ll also be given an option to &#8220;Revert to previous version.&#8221; This will copy the older version you are reviewing into the text area. Please note: Any unsaved changes will not be retained.</p>

<h5 id='recovering'>Recovering</h5>

<p>Alkaline keeps copies of most types of content should you accidentally delete something or decide you want to restore that data later.</p>

<p>To restore an item you previously deleted, go to <strong>Settings</strong> and click &#8220;Enter recovery mode&#8221;. You can then browse and search deleted content through your Dashboard. Once you&#8217;ve found the item you&#8217;d like to restore, click the &#8220;Restore&#8221; checkbox on the item&#8217;s Dashboard page, and save those changes.</p>

<p>You can restore as many items as you wish. When you&#8217;re done, you should exit recovery mode by going to <strong>Settings</strong> and clicking &#8220;Exit recovery mode.&#8221; Your once-deleted items will now be amongst the rest of your content.</p>
