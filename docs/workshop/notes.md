### Workshop Notes

Alkaline Workshops are intended to be tutorials or inspiration to build better Web sites using Alkaline by investigating and demystifying the techniques used by other successful Web sites. When using the Workshop guides, please note:

- **The Web sites discussed probably do not use Alkaline.** Most workshops will cover Web sites that were custom developed or rely on a different but heavily-modified CMS.

- **Not every feature will be covered.** Large Web sites--even those without complex social networking features--can cost well upwards of $10 million. We're going to highlight some of the most notable features from the Web sites covered.

- **Respect intellectual property.** Web design and user interaction models, like all creative works, are subject to U.S. and international copyright laws. Do not copy sites verbatim.

	You are, of course, allowed to and encouraged to copy the code we provide in our workshops.

- **Know your Alkaline.** Get comfortable beneath the hood. You should know how to modify templates and add extensions without referring to our reference guide. If you don't, brush up before diving in.

- **Make sure you're running the latest stable version of Alkaline.** Older versions may not be compatible.
